<p>Climate change is resulting in an increasing number and intensity of devastating storms, droughts and fires, as well as melting polar caps and glaciers creating rising sea levels and causing our rivers to flood and burst their banks. The deliberate destruction of trees, woodlands, forests and other fragile, essential, water-conserving ecosystems also contribute to risks of our fresh water supplies being depleted, poisoned or contaminated.</p>
<p>Flooding also results from deliberate cuts to flood defences; poor government choices, failures and policy errors; and particularly deliberate political policies that support the continued destructive activities of those responsible for driving the climate emergency. These, together with the world’s multiple humanitarian crises, are all compounding the impacts of the climate crisis, which is now putting us all at an unprecedented risk to our health, our own and our children&rsquo;s future.</p>
<p>The health impacts of the climate crisis, water pollution, flooding, droughts and water shortages, and their impacts on the environment and ecology, are devastating for any of us, but are especially challenging for disabled people, both young and old. This group of people – most of whom are already contending with austerity, aid and benefits cuts, coronavirus, etc – are at risk of being hit first and hardest by flooding and its impacts. For example, when flood waters rise, the able-bodied and physically healthy can more easily flee to safety or fight off any resulting infections.</p>
<p>To add to the impacts of the growing climate crisis, of flooding, droughts, fires, crop failures and the resulting environmental, ecological and humanitarian emergencies, the world’s greed-blinded leaders, governments and profit-driven, planet-destroying, power-corrupting corporations, fossil fuel industry and the, banking and the other sectors and industries that are driving the climate crisis are also increasingly escalating and compounding the impacts and risks.</p>
<p>For example, here in the UK, subsidised and supported by the UK Government, Fracking, HS2, construction sector, mining and other profiteering industrial processes are decimating ancient woodlands and vital, fragile, ecosystems as well as using up, privatising, commodifying and contaminating and depleting our precious, finite reserves of fresh water. A third of the world’s groundwater reserves are now in distress, according to NASA and it is estimated that by 2050 there will be a 22% shortfall in the water needed because of the climate emergency.</p>
<p>In preparation for this scenario, the rich are already escalating their privatisation and profiteering and preparing for wars over food and water, oblivious of the fact that al of life is connected and when we run out of water and the oceans rise and die they rise and die for them too. A Dec 2020 article in Bloomberg highlighted that ‘Water joined gold, oil and other commodities traded on Wall Street, highlighting worries that the life-sustaining natural resource may become scarce across more of the world.’</p>
<p>Also, Climate Central have produced an interactive COASTAL RISK SCREENING TOOL to show lands near London that are projected to be below the annual flood level by 2050. This includes some of the impacts to health from rising sea levels leading to flooding of land. Improved elevation data indicate far greater global threats from sea level rise and coastal flooding than previously thought, and thus greater benefits from reducing their causes.</p>
<p>Flooding and water contamination doesn’t just result in soil erosion, denudation, destruction and property damage; it also causes crop damage and crop failure, resulting in food insecurity, food shortages, hunger and starvation. Topsoil erosion depletes vital soil nutrients, which also affects vital ecosystems and agriculture – and, as a result, human food production. Flooding can also result in dangerous and devastating mud and landslides, as seen at the Eden Project during Storm Bella this Christmas.</p>
<h1 id="impact-flooding-human">The Impact of Flooding on Human Health</h1>
<img src="/images/manhole_cover.png" alt="" class="responsive">
<p><em>Overflowing manhole cover.      <font size="0.75em">(Ian Francis/Shutterstock.com)</font></em></p>
<p>According to a recent UK Public Health Report, ‘It is not only your property and possessions that can be damaged by flood waters – flooding can also have lasting impacts on your health and wellbeing.’ Such impacts include long-term physical and mental health damages.</p>
<p>As a result of being fast-flowing, flood waters are likely to be contaminated with bugs, so along with risks of drowning, there are additional risks of injury and disease for anyone coming into contact with it. For example, raw sewage coming into homes raises the possibility of unpleasant gastrointestinal infections. Human sewage can mix with flood waters through overflowing drains, septic tanks and toilets. Flood waters are often mixed with animal waste as floods wash through farmlands. Such polluted waters frequently cause diarrhoea, vomiting, stomach cramps and even death.  Additionally, according to the AA, a third of flood-related deaths are a result of drowning in a vehicle.</p>
<p>In addition, carbon monoxide poisoning – a silent killer – can be unleashed through flooding. The pumps and generators employed to help dry out buildings can give out gases with potentially lethal carbon monoxide poisoning if used incorrectly.</p>
<p>The mental and emotional health impacts are harder to quantify, but are no less devastating. Flood victims experience understandable stress and distress, not just from the effects of the immediate flooding, but also the strain of dealing with the after-effects of flooding – for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the endless and exhausting deep cleaning required;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the emotional effects from the loss of precious pets and irreplaceable sentimental belongings such as photos and other personal items;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the stress of dealing with insurance claims and local authorities, water boards and other agencies, particularly if they are unhelpful and unsympathetic; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>house prices falling, insurance rates rising, or homes becoming uninsurable or uninhabitable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Flood victims can also suffer years of related mental health issues such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), grief, trauma, anxiety and depression and several other debilitating effects that can persist long after the initial problems of flooding have been resolved.</p>
<p>Victims' loss of their homes through being made temporarily homeless and displaced also impact their daily routines, study and work, and include the stress of being separated from family and friends.  This can affect all people, regardless of age – children and young people are equally vulnerable. Longer-term mental, emotional and physical health impacts on individuals include problems such as separation anxiety; sleep disturbance; and behavioural problems, including becoming withdrawn, developing aggressive tendencies, bed-wetting, and addiction or overreliance on habit-forming substances as coping mechanisms. These can also place inordinate strains on relationships and communities.</p>
<p>Damage to property is bad enough, but the lack of sleep, security and safety; the endless exhaustion from having to pump out water and sewage, trying to salvage whatever is savable; trying to come to terms with the loss of what is irretrievably damaged or just washed away; having to have everything decontaminated and dried; needing walls cut back and re-plastered, carpets and floors redone; repairing damaged drains; deep cleaning and replacing items damaged by water or raw sewage: the after effects and impacts on health and well being can last years, including due to years of bearing financial costs, debt and worries.</p>
<p>Whether too much, or too little, or unsafe, problems with water result in loss of life –whether from drowning, fatal injuries, food shortages, or deadly water-borne diseases. According to a UN Water report, ‘240 babies die every hour from unsafe water’.</p>

<p>Rising global temperatures mean more rain – and more floods. We know that flooding is happening increasingly; even in the UK, we are already experiencing more and more huge downpours that saturate the water table and bring distress and ruin to many parts of the country. Perhaps many merely experience this as just some ‘inconvenience’ in their lives. Perhaps they consider the floods don’t affect them very much. But the fact is they do, and they surely will – both in this country and as a result of what’s happening abroad.</p>
<p>One of the biggest impacts of flooding, which is likely to affect us all in the very near future, thanks to global food-supply chains, is crop failure. Crop yields have been increasingly failing in recent years – both in the UK and globally. Food production in the UK and globally has been affected over the past 30 years; while the food imported to the UK from overseas represents about 45% of our consumption, our own food security is now a big issue.</p>
<p>Much of our food comes from European countries. According to an IPCC assessment, there is “high confidence that intense rainfall is an increasing trend in Europe, especially for winter flooding”. While here in the UK, we are “vulnerable to events at home like adverse weather. Equally, too much reliance on a few specific imports can leave a country exposed to international disruption.” This represents the dual threat to our food security as a result of increased rainfall.</p>
<p>There are two sides to the crop failure threat worldwide:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>extreme flooding and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>prolonged drought.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Increased unpredictability in the weather means that crops are damaged severely; some are either very greatly reduced or even a total loss in some countries. Globally billions of people are being affected by it. As a result, our food insecurity is likely to be both external and internal.</p>
<h2 id="climate-change-and-its-impact-on-crops">Climate change and its impact on crops</h2>
<p>It’s widely recognised that global weather systems have changed drastically and continue to change for the worse. Antonio Guterres, Secretary-General of the UN, is telling the truth when he declares that we are facing a climate emergency. He says, “The science is clear… we are going in the wrong direction. Our planet is broken&hellip;  Humanity is waging war with nature… this is suicidal!”.</p>
<p>The floods happening around the world continue to increase alarmingly, due to extreme ‘wild weather’ events. These extreme weather events are occurring with higher frequency and longer duration, causing huge damage to crop-growing, even leading to total crop failure. These affect regions on the Earth in various ways, depending on locality: torrential rainfall, storm surges in coastal regions, rivers bursting banks, and islands being submerged. Deforestation, removal of vegetation and poor land management can also cause greater flood risk.</p>
<p>In the past few years, the lower percentages of anticipated yields here in the UK have hit some farmers very badly, due to the untimely and persistent weather conditions. In the UK, too much rain has caused much distress around the country, with many people’s houses and business premises inundated.  Last year, a wet autumn drenched the soil and caused flooding in many areas, destroying or delaying crops across the country. Erosion and soil displacement from flooding can potentially ruin fields and destroy crops, as the fertile topsoil is washed away, leaving food-crop plants with nowhere to establish their roots. Sand, gravel, and rocks deposited by flood waters can also smother and destroy exposed crops.</p>
<p>Met Office meteorologist Aidan McGivern confirmed the UK is experiencing a changing climate, with warmer and wetter winters, and rainfall coming in heavier bursts during summers. He said the season of summer thunderstorms – like those recently seen in the southern half of the country – was likely to extend in future from spring to autumn, with heatwaves becoming more common.</p>
<p>Mark McCarthy, the head of the National Climate Information Centre at the Met Office echoed his findings, saying that “Climate change also increases the intensity of rainfall during the summer months. Heatwaves are followed by convective downpours. The challenge is knowing how to manage that.”</p>
<p>In fact, climatologists have been warning us for years about how our weather is bound to change due to global warming and climate change, with crop failure greatly increasing. How is this happening? We know that with higher global temperatures result in icecaps melting and sea levels rising. We have ever-increasing energy in the Earth’s air and ocean water systems, leading to higher evaporation, moisture content and cloud. Increased heating causes the huge rise in weather volatility – in extreme rainfall intensity – which, if prolonged, can be extremely costly to agricultural land because of delays in and reduction of crop harvest, as well as erosion removing topsoil.</p>
<p>A UK government website states: “If the soil is too wet, it can result in poor conditions for the crops to grow; when soil is well drained, then the oxygen, nutrients and trace elements that the plants nees are available.” Some cereal yields in the UK have decreased by 38% in 2020, due to prolonged rainfall and flooding at the usual time of sowing in the spring, with consequent low germination and prolonged and persistent heat towards summer months.</p>
<p>In other countries around the world, the threat of crop failure is even worse, meaning important food production worldwide has suffered greatly. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Asia</strong> is frequently affected by floods – floods in Southern China alone have engulfed huge swathes of farmland. <em>&ldquo;Not only did the rainfall ruin crops they were about to collect, but the scale of the flooding made it impossible to salvage anything annually. We are not going to have any harvest for the entire year.&quot;</em> - Bao Wentao’s</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In West <strong>Java</strong>, heavy rains ruined rice crops very badly and agricultural experts warned that climate change had begun to affect food production in many parts of the country.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In <strong>Mozambique</strong>, in the lowlands close to the rivers, Limpopo and Zambezi, people are experiencing frequent floods, and farmers and their crops are severely affected by extreme rainfall and droughts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Latin America</strong> and the <strong>Caribbean</strong> are affected mostly by floods, and to a lesser extent by drought and storms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <strong>US</strong>, torrential rains frequently drench the fields in the Midwest, leaving sodden soil unsuitable for planting millions of acres with corn, soybeans, and other crops. Adverse and extreme weather conditions such as floods, hurricanes, hail and tornadoes mean seeds for vital crops such as corn and soybean can&rsquo;t be sown. Sowing rates for corn and soybean have been greatly reduced in recent years, which many have described as the “lowest rates in history”. Some farmers end up planting nothing and declaring a total crop loss.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If we ourselves experience increased crop failure and food insecurity in future years, part of this will be because floods also impact the whole global ecosystems. But we should remember that food price increases are borne disproportionally by low-income countries, where people spend more or most of their income on food. Millions are at risk and suffering in the Global South, with crop failure cited as a leading cause of death, disease and increased migration, as subsistence farmers in particular are severely impacted by climate change and extreme weather events.</p>

<h2 id="climate-change-and-the-threat-of-flooding-in-the-uk">Climate change and the threat of flooding in the UK</h2>
<p>Already, nearly half a million Britons are affected by sea level-linked soil erosion. As the Arctic melts and sea levels rise, battered coasts, drainage overflows and road, property and field flooding jeopardise the 11.5 million people who live near estuaries.</p>
<p>The Thames Barrier helps protect £275 billion of property and infrastructure and was closed more than 50 times in the 2013–2014 winter – comfortably, a record. More than a quarter of the total closures in the Barrier’s 32-year history occurred in the 2013/14 winter.</p>
<p>Some 1.3 million people live in the Thames tidal floodplain and are therefore vulnerable to flooding if current defences fail or are overtaken by a climate-induced sea level rise; £275bn worth of property is also at risk.</p>
<p>The Environment Agency’s TE2100 Plan highlights that without effective mitigation of global greenhouse gas emissions, the Thames estuary may have to deal with sea level rise that exceeds the Barrier’s capacity.</p>
<p>Along the English Channel coast, the sea level has already risen by about 12cm in the last 100 years. With the warming we are already committed to over the next few decades, we can expect a further 11–16cm of sea level rise by 2030. This equates to 23–27cm of total sea level rise since 1900.</p>
<p>Flooding already poses a risk to vital infrastructure such as roads, fresh water supplies, sewage treatment plants, hospitals, schools and energy supplies, and the risk is projected to rise. By the 2080s, up to 1,800 schools could be exposed to ‘significant likelihood’ of flooding (a greater-than-one-in-75 annual chance).</p>
<p>During the 2020s decade, 35,000 hectares of high-quality horticultural and arable land are likely to be flooded at least once every three years. By the 2080s, this will reach 130,000 hectares of high-quality land – an area larger than Greater Manchester.</p>
<h2 id="economic-and-business-costs">Economic and business costs</h2>
<img src="/images/york_england_2015.png" alt="" class="responsive">
<p><em>York, England 2015.      <font size="0.75em">(PhilMacDPhoto/Shutterstock.com)</font></em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The costs of adapting are less than the cost of doing business as usual. And the benefits many times larger.&quot;</em> - Ban Ki-moon, 8th Secretary-General of the United Nations.</p>
<p>Flood damage currently costs the UK around £1.3 billion each year; the total economic damages for England from the winter 2015–2016 floods were estimated to be around £1.6bn, with 32% of total damages occurring to the business sector.</p>
<p>According to current projections, there is a 10% chance of a catastrophic flood happening in England within the next two decades, which could cause in excess of £10bn in damage. Such a flood would cause 10 times more flood damage than the combined impact of the tidal surge and storms in winter 2013–2014, and three to four times more damage than in 2007.</p>
<p>Flooding and other extreme weather events are likely to leave 2.5m homes at risk of flooding unless ministers take action. The UK economy could face hits of more than £12bn ($15.4bn) a year by 2050 from coastal damages alone if no action is taken to combat climate change, according to a recent report commissioned by conservation charity World Wildlife Fund.</p>
<p>The report states that floods, droughts and heatwaves could cost the economy tens of billions of pounds and hundreds of thousands of jobs by 2050.</p>
<p>A “natural capital” stress test found that flooding in 2050 on a similar scale to the winter of 2013–2014 would affect more than twice as many homes if current policies, such as allowing construction on flood plains, continue.</p>
<h2 id="property-and-insurance-costs-2020-uk-floods">Property and insurance costs: 2020 UK floods</h2>
<p>According to the Association of British Insurers (ABI), over 82,000 people claimed for flood or wind damage as a result of storms Dennis and Ciara in February 2020, and the total cost of repairing homes and businesses is expected to top £360 million.</p>
<p>The insurance – and potentially, reinsurance – market loss from flooding that struck the UK from 9–29 February 2020 is now estimated to have caused a total industry loss of US$500m (£375m), up 26% from an estimate made in April.</p>
<p>It was estimated that at least 4,800 properties were damaged by the February UK floods. Flood defences saved the damage from being much more widespread, which would have driven a significantly larger insurance and reinsurance market loss.
.
The UK’s winter 2020 flood experience began in November 2019, when large areas of northern England flooded, and continued into early 2020, with flood incidents in December and January, before the peak of the winter floods began with Storm Ciara in early February. As a result, the ground was already well saturated, thanks to a very wet winter in the UK and the previous flood incidents that affected the country.</p>
<p>This was then followed by further strong storms Dennis and Jorge, also in February. The total cost of this UK winter weather to the insurance and reinsurance sector is estimated by to be around UK £775m, or just over US $1bn.</p>
<h2 id="welsh-incident-costs-to-property-and-humans">Welsh incident: costs to property and humans</h2>
<img src="/images/nantgarw_wales.png" alt="" class="responsive">
<p><em>Nantgarw, Wales February 2020. <font size="0.75em">(Ceri Breeze/Shutterstock.com)</font></em></p>
<p>Take, for example, the critical flooding incident declared in Pontypridd, Wales, in February 2020, which saw a total of 1,000 homes flooded as heavy rain swept in with Storm Jorge.</p>
<p>Many of the 680 affected families were lacking insurance to cover the cost of replacing wrecked belongings. <em>&ldquo;People are being costed out of insurance. It is so astronomical. It costs between £70–£100 a month for home insurance.&quot;</em> - Heledd Fychan. And according to first minister Mark Drakeford, the total flood damage could cost up to £180m.</p>
<p>Linda Davis, a flood victim in Pontypridd, expressed exhaustion at the sheer stress and scale of damage to her home. The 73-year-old had spent all Saturday night watching the mud-brown river rise higher and higher. Letting her groceries drop beside the piles of sandbags protecting her house in Pontypridd from the once-again surging waters of the River Taff, she said,“It is frightening,” tears welling up in her eyes. “I’m just so tired.”</p>
<p>Davis&rsquo;s home, along with many of her neighbours' properties, had already been filled with a metre of contaminated floodwater in the aftermath of previous flooding caused by Storm Dennis; she and her 76-year-old husband had been without hot water and refrigeration for two weeks. “It’s been horrendous, and it could have easily come in again last night,” she added. “It didn’t, thank God – but there is more rain coming. We won’t be able to relax for a long time.”</p>
<p>Insurers say work to ensure Wales avoids significant flooding in the future could “easily” cost more than £500m, but claim such costs are “needed” in the next decade.</p>
<h2 id="the-cost-to-animals-and-nature">The cost to animals and nature</h2>
<p><em>&ldquo;The Earth is in a death spiral. It will take radical action to save us.&quot;</em> - George Monbiot, Guardian journalist</p>
<p>Along with the devastation to human lives and properties in the recent spate of deadly storms hitting the UK, animals were also severely affected by the floods. For example, hundreds of animals are thought to have drowned in the floods before Christmas 2019 in Cumbria, with increased wildlife casualties during surging amid fears over &lsquo;polluted&rsquo; wetlands.</p>
<p>While the terrible loss of lives and homes has been well-documented, the damage to bird, mammal, fish and insect populations, and habitats will also have a long-term impact on the ecosystem. Seals, moles, hedgehogs, badgers, mice, earthworms and a host of insects and seabirds are among the unseen casualties of the floods, storms and torrential rains of the 2020 storms, say wildlife groups.</p>
<p>As the waters started to subside across England during the February 2020 storms, conservationists reported that about 600 guillemots, puffins, razorbills, kittiwakes and gulls had been washed up on the south coast, as 250 seals drowned in Norfolk, Cornwall and the Channel Islands. A further 11,000 seabirds were reportedly found dead on the French coast.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The relentless storms hitting our coast have had a cumulative effect on animals, which can usually cope with bad weather, but are now on really low reserves and are dying in large numbers,&quot;</em> said Niki Clear from Cornwall Wildlife Trust, which has reported that dozens of seal pups were washed up on beaches.</p>
<h1 id="flooding-impacts-ecosystems">Flooding Impacts on Ecosystems</h1>
<p>The latest UK State of the Climate Report, published on 30 July 2020 by the International Journal of Climatology, contains several indicators that the UK climate is getting wetter, illustrating that total rainfalls over a five-day period were 4% higher during the most recent decade (2008–2017), compared to the period between 1961–1990. The amount of rain from extremely wet days has increased by 17% when compared to the same time periods. In addition, there is a slight increase in the longest sequence of consecutive wet days for the UK.</p>
<p>The winters of 2013–2014 and 2015–2016 have been the two wettest on record, with widespread impacts – including flooding – during both seasons. A Met Office study shows that an extended period of extreme winter rainfall in the UK, similar to that seen in the winter of 2013–2014, is now about seven times more likely due to human-induced climate change. Past trends show that  winter rainfall has intensified and increasingly occurred in clustered events.</p>
<p>These factors were seen in the recent (December 2015) Storm Desmond in Cumbria, which researchers alleged was &lsquo;the most extreme flooding in 600 years&rsquo;, with larger sedimentary deposits in nearby streams and hills indicating that recent flooding was much more extreme in recent years. During this storm, more than 341mm (13ins) of rain fell in parts of Cumbria in just 24 hours.</p>
<p>The increase of flooding events in the UK not only impacts humans, but also affects wildlife and disrupts entire ecosystems. Coastal areas are further at risk from the combination of storm surges and increased rainfall and river flow, which results in ‘compound flooding’.</p>
<p>Climate change is having an impact on many levels, not least on many vital ecosystems, thus further degrading and destroying the biodiversity we rely on. Flood waters not only threaten to overwhelm fragile ecosystems, but the resulting soil erosion further contributes to habitat and biodiversity loss.</p>
<h2 id="disruption-to-species-caused-by-changing-weather-patterns">Disruption to species caused by changing weather patterns</h2>
<p>Fluctuations in seasonal and weather patterns negatively impact flora and fauna alike, resulting in further degradation of entire ecosystems. This is something we absolutely cannot afford to remain indifferent to or allow to continue, as we rely on having healthy ecosystems – including those underground or in areas we cannot easily observe – to support a variety of species. These, in turn, are vital to our own survival as a species.</p>
<p>Even the merest shift in the timing of seasonal flooding will disrupt lifecycle stages of various flora and fauna far more than if had they occurred in line with normal seasonal patterns. This applies equally to underground habitats, which are rarely investigated or understood, because they remain out of sight.</p>
<p>For example, any disruption to the normal lifecycles of insects and fungi will have far-reaching impacts on wider, more visible ecosystems. The lifecycles of fungi are vital to the lifecycles of other species, and so have a key role in sustaining the overall health of ecosystems. This includes the many species of pollinating insects that nest on or below the ground, and which are responsible for creating human food supplies.</p>
<h2 id="impacts-on-estuaries">Impacts on estuaries</h2>
<p>Flooding mixed with pollution is another negative impact on marine ecosystems, such as estuarine, river, wetland and coastal habitats. Flooding increases the flow of polluted drain water from roads and agricultural land. These can destroy fragile ecosystems in marsh and wetland areas, including the streams and rivers that later feed into seas via estuaries.</p>
<p>Changes in levels of salinity in estuaries are also likely to affect the diversity and distribution of fauna species. A projected increase in the salinity range in estuarine habitats may further reduce biodiversity – for example, of some species found in the Thames Estuary (Attrill, 2002).</p>
<p>Species found in the Thames tidal basin include 125 types of fish (bream, perch, pike, roach, dace, ruffe, barbel, native and non-native carp, chub and gudgeon, among others), according to Ian Tokelove of the London Wildlife Trust, and mammals such as harbour seals, grey seals, harbour porpoises and bottlenose dolphins. Key Thames Tidal Estuary bird species include avocet, black-tailed godwits, dark-bellied brent geese, dunlins, lapwings, gadwalls, grey plovers, oystercatchers, redshanks, shelducks, shovelers and knots, among others).</p>
<p>Estuarine habitats are biologically important and are often very rich in biodiversity, especially in the UK, where plentiful estuarine habitats support many unique and rare species. Estuarine habitats include important nursery areas for commercial fishery species, as well as feeding and breeding areas for terrestrial populations, such as birds (Sharps et al., 2015). UK estuaries are also significant process centres for coastal hydrological, biogeochemical and biological cycles; their biological productivity rivals those of tropical rainforests and coral reefs (Cai, 2011).</p>
<h2 id="impacts-to-coastal-nature-reserves">Impacts to coastal nature reserves</h2>
<p>More than a third of the UK&rsquo;s national nature reserves are in coastal areas and, like much of the coast, suffer threats from increased erosion, coastal squeeze, habitat loss and saline intrusion, making the fulfilment of some of the government&rsquo;s current targets for biodiversity difficult or impossible in the long term.</p>
<p>At a single UK nature reserve – the Backwarden site of special scientific interest (SSSI) in Essex – 29%–49% of plant species show a trend of decreasing (including three species identified as a conservation priority by the site manager). However, in all such studies, the observations depend on the climate scenario used.</p>
<h1 id="impact-sea-level">The Impact of Sea Level Rise</h1>
<p>Global sea level rise is accelerating. Seas are now rising by 5mm per year, which is already impacting numerous cities around the world.</p>
<p>Due to increased coastal flooding and erosion, up to 1.5 million UK homes may be threatened by 2080. New government policies are urgently needed to protect homes, with the chief executive of the Committee on Climate Change saying that the current approach “really isn’t fit for purpose”, with the risk of up to £212 billion in annual coastal flooding damages by 2100.</p>
<h2 id="thames-barrier">Thames Barrier</h2>
<p>Due in part to high tides, which had not been seen in the region for over 60 years, the UK Thames Barrier was forced to close 50 times during 2013–2014, as the Barrier having a design limit of a maximum of 50 closures during each year. A total of 1.25 million people live in the Thames Tidal Basin floodplain area; these are vhighly vulnerable to the devastating impacts of flooding if the Thames Barrier were to fail or be overtaken by greater-than-expected sea-level rise.</p>
<h2 id="risk-of-flooding">Risk of flooding</h2>
<p>Coastal areas are facing significant risk from flooding, in part due to rising sea levels. Many communities are not taking coastal protection for granted, even where extreme storm surge is increasingly higher than the last event, and despite many smaller areas lacking criteria for government funding for flooding defense.</p>
<h1 id="water-scarcity-uk">Water Scarcity in the UK</h1>
<img src="/images/severe_drought.png" alt="" class="responsive">
<p><em><font size="0.75em">(Simon Annable/Shutterstock.com)</font></em></p>
<p>Despite our focus on the problems of flooding caused by changing weather patterns, severe storms and rising sea levels, water scarcity is another problem exacerbated by climate change. By this we mean clear, non-polluted, non-toxic, actually drinkable and life-sustaining H20.</p>
<p>Worldwide, some four billion of the planet’s 7.8 billion people endure water scarcity for at least one month per year, and 0.5 billion people already suffer water scarcity year-round. At the present time, those living in the UK are not yet among those hardest-hit by water scarcity (the UK is among those depicted on a world map showing levels of water scarcity as only a &lsquo;vulnerable&rsquo; country.)</p>
<p>But that is likely to change soon. Projections indicate London’s 2018 population of almost 9 million could soar to 13.4 million by 2050, with water demand outpacing supply by 20% even by 2040. And the UK’s total population may soar from 67 million in 2018 to 75 million in 2050. While England has been long noted for its frequent rainy and foggy weather, precipitation in southeastern England will be especially affected by the climate crisis, which will bring increasingly hotter and drier summers without drastic preventive actions.</p>
<p>The British Isles have suffered several grim, brief, warning “previews” of prospective future droughts and heat waves in recent decades. From June–August 1976, 20% of “excess deaths” occurred in the UK; £500m of crops failed (hiking food prices by 12%); and forest fires raged in parts of southern England, destroying some 50,000 trees in Dorset, England, among other effects. Heat waves recurred in 1995 and 2003, too.</p>
<p>In 2019, Sir James Bevan, the longtime diplomat named chief executive of the UK’s Environment Agency in 2015, bluntly estimated that England would suffer serious water shortages, within just 20–25 years. An article on the BBC website, posted on 19 March 2019, echoed an official report from July 2018 in which Bevan foretold of the <em>&ldquo;jaws of death – the point at which, unless we take action, we will not have enough water to supply our needs.&quot;</em> 
Consequences of water scarcity include a range of effects – from a reduction in water sports activities such as canoeing and punting to wildlife and, ultimately, to many more thirsty humans. Millions of people, especially those who are less fortunate, could suffer from lack of this vital, life-sustaining fluid. Yet, average daily household water usage rose from 85 liters in the 1960s to 143 liters now.</p>
